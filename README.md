# Password_Generator-using-OOP in Python
This Project demonstrates using Object Oriented Programming to create a code that serves as a password generator.

## Project Overview:

This project is a Python-based password generator that creates strong, unique passwords based on user input. 

The program provides two classes: Password_Generator and Advanced_Password_Generator. 

The PasswordGenerator class generates passwords with customizable length, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 

The AdvancedPasswordGenerator class extends the base class by ensuring a minimum number of unique characters in the generated password.

## Purpose:
